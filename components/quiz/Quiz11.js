              This is a major misconception in Jamaica. A woman who wants to
              leave a violent relationship can do so even if she has children.
              The law will make sure that the father provides for his children
              even after their mother leaves him. Additionally, children who
              have to liv e in a violent home can suffer serious emotional
              trauma from being exposed to this violence.

              Having children does not prevent a woman from leaving the abusive
              father of her children. There law can make sure that the father
              maintains his children even after their mother leaves him.
              Additionally, children who have to live in a violent home can be
              badly affected by their exposure to this violence. .
